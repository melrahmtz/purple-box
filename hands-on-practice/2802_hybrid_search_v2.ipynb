South  Africa  was  represented  by  the universities of Cape Town, Limpopo, Pretoria, Sefako Makgatho, Stellenbosch, Walter Sisulu and Witwatersrand.  \\nResults: Six  major  themes  were  identified:  (1)  context  is  critical,  (2)  learning  style  of  the registrar and (teaching style) of the supervisor, (3) learning portfolio is utilised, (4) interactions between registrar and supervisor, (5) giving and receiving feedback and (6) the competence of the supervisor.  \\nConclusion :  The  training of family physicians across Africa shares many common themes. However, there are also big differences among the various countries and even programmes within countries. The way forward would include exploring the local contextual enablers that influence the learning conversations between trainees and their supervisors. Family medicine training  institutions  and  organisations  (such  as  WONCA  Africa  and  the  South  African Academy of Family Physicians) have a critical role to play in supporting trainees and trainers towards  developing  local  competencies  which  facilitate  learning  in  the  clinical  workplace dominated by service delivery pressures.', 'table_data': None, 'source': '17.md', 'section': 'Corresponding author:  ', 'chunk_position': 3}\n",

We  particularly  wanted  to explore  the  interaction  between  the  registrar  and  supervisor in the workplace, captured in a portfolio of learning, and in the African  context. We  sought  a  clearer  understanding  of  what it  means  to  be  observed  while  conducting  a  consultation  or performing  a  procedure,  as  well  as  understanding  the  local experience of giving or receiving feedback, and how various educational meetings are conducted.', 'table_data': None, 'source': '17.md', 'section': 'Unknown', 'chunk_position': 4}\n",

The group members expressed feeling encouraged and felt motivated to use 'small moments, little bits, part of the mini-CEX' during learning interactions in the workplace (teachable  moments).  This  will  allow  the  supervisors  and registrars to be 'more real' in the workplace, as opposed to striving for the hard-to-reach  perfect or ideal learning interactions. It will necessitate a more honest and pragmatic approach  to  harness  these  learning  moments.  Ongoing discussions  are  needed  around  the  validity  of  continuous assessments  in  the  workplace  for  national  examinations, such as the Fellowship of the College of Family Physicians of South Africa (FCFP[SA]), and the contribution of the learning portfolio to exit examination results. Collaborative training projects, like Training the Clinical Trainers (TCT) project and 'FamLEAP'  initiative,  are  trying  to  address  the  need  for training of supervisors in South Africa and also now Malawi and  other  countries  in  Africa  in  basic  workplace-based educational skills, such as formative assessment and giving feedback. 13\", 'table_data': None, 'source': '17.md', 'section': 'Reflection on workshop  ', 'chunk_position': 14}\n",

In  many  programmes,  a  learning  plan  is  drawn up  per  rotation,  with  objectives  linked  to  the  curriculum. Areas  of  existing  competence  and  gaps  in  prior  learning are identified and converted into learning objectives. Conversations with the supervisor help to develop a strategy to  achieve  the  learning  objectives.  Participants  were  using tools like the mini-clinical evaluation exercise (CEX), logbook and  direct  observation  of  procedural  skills  (DOPS).  These were often used at patient encounters and in meetings with their supervisor.  \\nIn  terms of WBA, participants utilised a global assessment tool. Typically, there was one assessment at the end of each rotation,  completed by both registrar and family physician supervisor, which was also used for shared reflection. There were  also  continuous  assessments  every  2  weeks  within training modules, where the registrars presented a specific topic to the supervisor, with a short 'quiz' involving a number of questions on the topic. Some programmes had quarterly assessments.  \\nOne  of  the  challenges  experienced  with  the  portfolio  of learning, which is mostly paper-based at present, is implementation  of  the  portfolio  by  the  registrars  during every day clinical practice, as well as training of supervisors (faculty development).\", 'table_data': None, 'source': '17.md', 'section': 'Learning portfolio is utilised  ', 'chunk_position': 9}\n",

There  must  be  a balance between training in a district hospital and primary health care (PHC) settings. Participants spoke of accreditation of a 'teaching campus' in the district where training would be provided  by  a  network  of  different  facilities  or  locations. Rotation in specialist disciplines at referral hospitals tended to  cause  a  sense  of  disconnect  with  the  ethos  of  family medicine. In some programmes, registrars were based mostly in a tertiary setting, without on-site supervision by a family physician. Trainees then experienced a sense of dissonance, often missing the psychosocial aspects of patient care, as the specialist  environment  was  mainly  biomedical  in  nature. Without regular meetings with a family physician, it became a challenge to change the thinking of the trainee after his or her tertiary setting exposure.  \\nThe placement of registrars in the district was seen as strategic in terms of building the capacity of health teams. The risk, however,  is  that  service  provision  overshadows  learning, with  a  perception  that  the  registrar  is  there  to  cover  staff shortages.  Indeed,  registrars  often  provide  supervision  to mid-level health workers and medical assistants (similar to clinical officers or clinical associates).  \\nWithin  the  right  context  (district),  the  supervisor  plays  a key  role  in  modelling  to  the  registrar,  for  example,  how to approach  patients with challenging conditions in a comprehensive way, while making  use of appropriate resources.  \\nIn  some  programmes,  the  initial  training  model  started with international partners using a hub and spokes model, with training mainly occurring in ambulatory care settings (the spokes), linked with rotations in specialist departments (the hub of the regional hospital). A regular challenge is the geographic distances between the universities in the city and the district hospital in the periphery.\", 'table_data': None, 'source': '17.md', 'section': 'Context is critical  ', 'chunk_position': 7}\n",

Some  medical  schools  promoted  more  problembased learning, with some emphasising self-directed learning, while  others  still  adhered  to  mainly  didactic  teaching.  This determined the registrar's ability to drive their own learning. Furthermore, the previous learning and teaching exposure of the  supervisor  also  became  relevant,  especially  if  their  own training  was  influenced  by  a  traditional  specialty  versus  a family medicine approach. The importance of aligning learning styles and creating continuity between the undergraduate and postgraduate  learning  phases  was  recognised.

Postgraduate training for family medicine in Africa takes place in the clinical workspace at the bedside or next to the patient in the clinic, district hospital or regional hospital. Direct supervisor observation, exchange of reflection and feedback, and learning conversations between the supervisor and the registrar are central to learning and assessment processes.  \\n2 George Regional Hospital, Eden, Western Cape Department of Health, South Africa  \\n3 Mossel Bay Hospital, Eden, Western Cape Department of Health, South Africa', 'table_data': None, 'source': '17.md', 'section': 'Family medicine training in Africa: Views of clinical trainers and trainees  ', 'chunk_position': 2}\n",

The group members expressed feeling encouraged and felt motivated to use 'small moments, little bits, part of the mini-CEX' during learning interactions in the workplace (teachable  moments).  This  will  allow  the  supervisors  and registrars to be 'more real' in the workplace, as opposed to striving for the hard-to-reach  perfect or ideal learning interactions. It will necessitate a more honest and pragmatic approach  to  harness  these  learning  moments.  Ongoing discussions  are  needed  around  the  validity  of  continuous assessments  in  the  workplace  for  national  examinations, such as the Fellowship of the College of Family Physicians of South Africa (FCFP[SA]), and the contribution of the learning portfolio to exit examination results. Collaborative training projects, like Training the Clinical Trainers (TCT) project and 'FamLEAP'  initiative,  are  trying  to  address  the  need  for training of supervisors in South Africa and also now Malawi and  other  countries  in  Africa  in  basic  workplace-based educational skills, such as formative assessment and giving feedback. 13\", 'table_data': None, 'source': '17.md', 'section': 'Reflection on workshop  ', 'chunk_position': 14}\n",

In the buzz pairs, we explored the questions of how do I teach or learn, supervise  or  be  supervised,  and  assess  or  be  assessed. This was followed by an interactive focus group discussion on  the  reflections  created  by  the  buzz  pair  discussions (a guiding style was employed to facilitate this discussion). The  group  reflections  were  captured  on  a  flip  chart  by  a scribe.  Common  themes  were  identified.  Clarification  was sought and  validated immediately  with the workshop participants.

There  must  be  a balance between training in a district hospital and primary health care (PHC) settings. Participants spoke of accreditation of a 'teaching campus' in the district where training would be provided  by  a  network  of  different  facilities  or  locations. Rotation in specialist disciplines at referral hospitals tended to  cause  a  sense  of  disconnect  with  the  ethos  of  family medicine. In some programmes, registrars were based mostly in a tertiary setting, without on-site supervision by a family physician. Trainees then experienced a sense of dissonance, often missing the psychosocial aspects of patient care, as the specialist  environment  was  mainly  biomedical  in  nature. Without regular meetings with a family physician, it became a challenge to change the thinking of the trainee after his or her tertiary setting exposure.  \\nThe placement of registrars in the district was seen as strategic in terms of building the capacity of health teams. The risk, however,  is  that  service  provision  overshadows  learning, with  a  perception  that  the  registrar  is  there  to  cover  staff shortages.  Indeed,  registrars  often  provide  supervision  to mid-level health workers and medical assistants (similar to clinical officers or clinical associates).  \\nWithin  the  right  context  (district),  the  supervisor  plays  a key  role  in  modelling  to  the  registrar,  for  example,  how to approach  patients with challenging conditions in a comprehensive way, while making  use of appropriate resources.  \\nIn  some  programmes,  the  initial  training  model  started with international partners using a hub and spokes model, with training mainly occurring in ambulatory care settings (the spokes), linked with rotations in specialist departments (the hub of the regional hospital). A regular challenge is the geographic distances between the universities in the city and the district hospital in the periphery.\", 'table_data': None, 'source': '17.md', 'section': 'Context is critical  ', 'chunk_position': 7}\n",

Some  medical  schools  promoted  more  problembased learning, with some emphasising self-directed learning, while  others  still  adhered  to  mainly  didactic  teaching.  This determined the registrar's ability to drive their own learning. Furthermore, the previous learning and teaching exposure of the  supervisor  also  became  relevant,  especially  if  their  own training  was  influenced  by  a  traditional  specialty  versus  a family medicine approach. The importance of aligning learning styles and creating continuity between the undergraduate and postgraduate  learning  phases  was  recognised.  Participants confirmed that the patient remains the best teacher.

In  many  programmes,  a  learning  plan  is  drawn up  per  rotation,  with  objectives  linked  to  the  curriculum. Areas  of  existing  competence  and  gaps  in  prior  learning are identified and converted into learning objectives. Conversations with the supervisor help to develop a strategy to  achieve  the  learning  objectives.  Participants  were  using tools like the mini-clinical evaluation exercise (CEX), logbook and  direct  observation  of  procedural  skills  (DOPS).  These were often used at patient encounters and in meetings with their supervisor.  \\nIn  terms of WBA, participants utilised a global assessment tool. Typically, there was one assessment at the end of each rotation,  completed by both registrar and family physician supervisor, which was also used for shared reflection. There were  also  continuous  assessments  every  2  weeks  within training modules, where the registrars presented a specific topic to the supervisor, with a short 'quiz' involving a number of questions on the topic. Some programmes had quarterly assessments.  \\nOne  of  the  challenges  experienced  with  the  portfolio  of learning, which is mostly paper-based at present, is implementation  of  the  portfolio  by  the  registrars  during every day clinical practice, as well as training of supervisors (faculty development).\", 'table_data': None, 'source': '17.md', 'section': 'Learning portfolio is utilised  ', 'chunk_position': 9}\n"
